Q: The pop method from Vec<T> in the standard libary is implemented for all T, but the pop method from our StackVec is only implemented when T implements the Clone trait. Why might that be? What goes wrong when the bound is removed?

A: Standard `Vec` use `unsafe` to get the element from the allocated slice.
And `StackVec` may not use `unsafe`.
