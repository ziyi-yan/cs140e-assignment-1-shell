Q: Read through the tests we have provided in src/tests.rs. Which tests would
fail to compile if the Deref implementation did not exist? What about the DerefMut
implementation? Why?

A: Every tests use [] as Index or IndexMut or use .iter() will failed.
After `StackVec` implemented `Deref` and `DerefMut`, the _deref coercion_
happens when those operations applied to `StackVec`.
